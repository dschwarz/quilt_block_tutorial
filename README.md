<h1>Quilt Block Tutorial</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to display step-by-step quilt block instructions in a simple, yet pretty way.</p>

<p>Each quilt block is defined in a JSON object.  A JavaScript quilt "block" object is initialized with the name of the block.  The object reads the JSON definition and then executes canvas drawing functions based on the definition.</p>

<p>There are no images on the tutorial pages.  All the quilt block graphics are done with the HTML5 canvas tag.</p>

<p>This project uses Twitter Bootstrap for page layout, with customized CSS for a brighter, flatter look.  It takes advantage of Bootstrap's responsive functionality and looks pretty on desktops, tablets, and phones.</p>
